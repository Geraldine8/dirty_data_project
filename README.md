# dirty_data_project

This project involves analyzing survey responses from individuals across various countries to gain insights into their preferences and satisfaction levels when receiving different types of candies and treats during Halloween. My goal is to identify patterns and factors that influence people's satisfaction levels and understand how they differ across regions. For a more detailed analysis and visualizations of my findings, please visit https://geraldine8.github.io/dirty_data_project/ , where I share the results of my analysis.
